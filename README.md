### Hi, I'm Endi ðŸ‘‹ 
<hr>

I am a full stack web developer, 
I have known the world of programming since 2016, and while in college I studied it, and started working in the industrial world in January 2021, until now I am very happy in this world of programming, and so far I have gained a lot of experience and very useful knowledge for me.
